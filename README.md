# Cutie Orange's Hawaii Fresh

## About
Our ʻāina provides us with abundant resources! Loving hands grow, harvest, and mold materials to create only the best products for our ‘ohana. In farmers markets, individuals come together to deliver a cornucopia of things. You’ll find home-grown organic produce, plants, pastries, and more. So where are these farmers markets? 

HiFresh lets you know when and where there’s a farmers market happening in your neighborhood and around the island!
